## Forking this repo

A few people have reached out to me asking me if they can use this code for their own personal website, and the answer to that question is absolutely **yes, but please give credit**.

I made with project a public repo so that others can use and build off of it to become bettwe developers/engineers. All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own and give credit where credit is due.

If you have any questions feel free to message me but also refer to the react docs <a href="https://reactjs.org">here</a> for more information about React specific concerns.

### TL;DR

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to [armaankara.com](https://armaankara.com). Thanks!
